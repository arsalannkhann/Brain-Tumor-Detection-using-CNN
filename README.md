# Brain Tumor Detection System 🧠

## Project Description
A web-based application that uses deep learning to detect brain tumors from MRI scans. The system classifies into four categories: glioma, meningioma, pituitary, and no tumor.

## Features ✨
- **Instant Analysis**: Immediate results upon MRI scan upload
- **High Accuracy**: Utilizes advanced deep learning model
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and interactive UI
- **Real-Time Preview**: Instant preview of uploaded images
- **Reliable Results**: Confidence score with each prediction

## Tech Stack 🛠️
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Deep Learning**: TensorFlow
- **Image Processing**: PIL, NumPy
- **Deployment**: Render
